// An entry names a scene of the catalogue (catalog.ts), the CSS size it is
// drawn at, and optionally the rectangle inside it to keep, for a picture
// of one card rather than a whole screen. The suite's `shown` project draws
// each one at `SHOWN_SCALE` device pixels per CSS pixel and compares it with
// tests/__shown__/<name>.png; the site's build converts those files into the
// sizes it serves (site/scripts/generate-screens.ts), and `<Screen name>`
// embeds one by its name.
//
// It imports nothing, not even the catalogue's types: the site reads this
// file into its own build and typecheck, where the kit's sources do not
// load. `src/__tests__/shown.test.ts` holds every entry to the catalogue.
