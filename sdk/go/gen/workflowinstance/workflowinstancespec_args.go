// WorkflowInstanceArgs contains the configuration arguments for creating a WorkflowInstance.
//
// This struct follows the Pulumi Args pattern for resource configuration.
//
// WorkflowInstanceSpec defines the user-configurable properties for a WorkflowInstance.
//
//	This is the "Instance" layer in the Template→Instance→Execution pattern.
//	It provides stateful configuration with environment bindings and secrets.
//
//	The spec contains:
//	- A reference to the Workflow template (the orchestration blueprint)
//	- Descriptive metadata for humans
//	- Environment references (layered configuration with secrets)
//
//	Design Philosophy:
//	WorkflowInstanceSpec separates "what to run" (Workflow) from "how to run it" (Environments).
//	This allows the same Workflow template to be instantiated multiple times with different
//	configurations (dev vs prod, different cloud accounts, different teams).
type WorkflowInstanceArgs struct {
	// Reference to the Workflow template this instance deploys.   This links the instance to a reusable orchestration blueprint.  The Workflow defines which AgentInstances to orchestrate and in what order.   Format: Workflow resource ID (e.g., "wfl-abc123")  Validation: Minimum length of 1 character (required field)   Example: "wfl-abc123" (references a Workflow named "deploy-to-cloud")
	WorkflowId string `json:"workflowId,omitempty"`
	// Human-readable description explaining what this instance is for.   Use this to document:  - Purpose of this instance  - Environment it targets (dev, staging, prod)  - Team or project ownership  - Special configuration notes   Examples:  - "Production CI/CD pipeline for main branch"  - "Staging environment deployment for feature testing"  - "Data pipeline for analytics team - runs daily at midnight"  - "Customer onboarding workflow for ACME Corp"
	Description string `json:"description,omitempty"`
	// References to Environment resources providing configuration and secrets.   Environments are layered configuration containers that provide:  - Environment variables (API keys, endpoints, flags)  - Secrets (credentials, tokens, passwords)  - Configuration values (timeouts, limits, settings)   Layering Behavior:  Environments are merged in order - later environments override earlier ones.  This enables a base + overrides pattern:   Example layering:    [base-env, aws-prod-env, github-team-env]    └─ base-env: Common settings for all instances    └─ aws-prod-env: AWS production credentials (overrides base AWS settings)    └─ github-team-env: Team-specific GitHub tokens (overrides generic tokens)   Use Cases:  - Single env: [prod-env] - Simple, all config in one place  - Base + specific: [base, prod] - Common config + environment-specific  - Layered: [base, cloud, team] - Base + cloud credentials + team settings   References use ApiResourceReference which supports:  - By ID: {id: "env-abc123"}  - By slug: {slug: "aws-prod-env"}   At execution time, the WorkflowExecution runtime merges these environments  and provides the combined configuration to all agents in the workflow.
	EnvRefs []*types.ApiResourceReference `json:"envRefs,omitempty"`
