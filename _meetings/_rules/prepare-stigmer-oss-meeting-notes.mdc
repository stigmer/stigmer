# Rule: Prepare Meeting Notes (action)

Purpose: When invoked, transform raw meeting transcripts and materials from `_meetings/_workspace/` into structured meeting notes with proper naming conventions and organization.

Usage: Invoke explicitly as `@prepare-meeting-notes` after a meeting with raw materials in the workspace.

## Input

Raw materials typically found in `_meetings/_workspace/`:
- Transcript files (`.md`, `.txt`)
- Screenshots or images
- Notes or agenda documents

## Output

Structured files in `_meetings/`:
- `YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS.[topic].notes.md` - Structured meeting notes
- `YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS.[topic].transcript.md` - Cleaned transcript (if applicable)

## Process

1. **Read Raw Materials**
   - Check `_meetings/_workspace/` for input files
   - Identify transcript, notes, and any images

2. **Generate Timestamp**
   - Run `date +"%Y-%m-%d-%H%M%S"` for the file prefix
   - Or use meeting date if specified

3. **Create Structured Notes**
   ```markdown
   # Meeting: [Topic]

   **Date**: [Date]
   **Attendees**: [Extracted from transcript or provided]
   **Duration**: [If known]

   ## Agenda
   [Topics covered]

   ## Discussion Summary
   [Key points from the meeting]

   ## Decisions Made
   - [Decision 1]
   - [Decision 2]

   ## Action Items
   - [ ] [Action] - @[Owner]
   - [ ] [Action] - @[Owner]

   ## Notes
   [Additional context or details]

   ## Follow-up
   [Next meeting, deadlines, etc.]
   ```

4. **Clean Transcript** (if provided)
   - Remove filler words and false starts
   - Fix speaker attributions
   - Add paragraph breaks for readability
   - Preserve technical accuracy

5. **Handle Images**
   - Move to `_meetings/_images/` if needed
   - Update references in notes

6. **Cleanup Workspace**
   - After processing, workspace files can be deleted or archived

## File Naming Convention

```
YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS.[topic-slug].notes.md
YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS.[topic-slug].transcript.md
```

Examples:
- `2025-01-15-143000.product-roadmap.notes.md`
- `2025-01-15-143000.product-roadmap.transcript.md`

## Notes

- Topic slug should be kebab-case, descriptive but concise
- Multiple meetings on same day differentiated by timestamp
- Raw workspace files can be deleted after processing
