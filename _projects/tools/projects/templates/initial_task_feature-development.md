# Task T01: Feature Analysis and Design

**Created**: {created_date}
**Status**: PENDING REVIEW
**Type**: Feature Development

⚠️ **This plan requires your review before execution**

## Objective

Analyze requirements and design the implementation approach for: {project_goal}

## Background

This feature development will enhance {project_components} using {project_tech}.

## Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: Requirements Analysis (Current)

1. **Understand Feature Scope**
   - [ ] Review feature requirements and acceptance criteria
   - [ ] Identify user stories or use cases
   - [ ] Map out user interactions and workflows
   - [ ] Define edge cases and error scenarios

2. **Technical Analysis**
   - [ ] Examine current implementation of {project_components}
   - [ ] Identify integration points
   - [ ] Assess impact on existing functionality
   - [ ] Review relevant existing patterns and conventions

3. **Dependency Mapping**
   - [ ] Identify required libraries or services
   - [ ] Check for breaking changes or compatibility issues
   - [ ] Map data flow and state management needs

### Phase 2: Design

1. **Architecture Design**
   - [ ] Create high-level component design
   - [ ] Define interfaces and contracts
   - [ ] Plan data models and schemas
   - [ ] Design API endpoints (if applicable)

2. **Implementation Strategy**
   - [ ] Break down into implementable chunks
   - [ ] Define order of implementation
   - [ ] Identify what can be done in parallel
   - [ ] Plan for incremental delivery

3. **Testing Strategy**
   - [ ] Define test scenarios
   - [ ] Plan unit test coverage
   - [ ] Design integration tests
   - [ ] Create acceptance test criteria

### Phase 3: Validation

1. **Design Review**
   - [ ] Validate approach with stakeholders
   - [ ] Confirm alignment with project goals
   - [ ] Address any concerns or feedback

2. **Risk Assessment**
   - [ ] Identify potential risks
   - [ ] Plan mitigation strategies
   - [ ] Define rollback approach

## Success Criteria for T01

- Clear understanding of feature requirements
- Documented technical design
- Identified dependencies and risks
- Approved implementation approach
- Ready to begin T02 (Implementation)

## Next Task Preview

**T02: Core Implementation** - Implement the main feature functionality based on the design from T01.

## Notes

- Focus on getting the design right before coding
- **IMPORTANT**: Only document in knowledge folders after ASKING for permission:
  - Design decisions require developer confirmation
  - Coding guidelines require developer confirmation  
  - Wrong assumptions require developer confirmation
- Task logs (T##_1_feedback.md, T##_2_execution.md) can be updated freely
## Review Process

**What happens next**:
1. **You review this plan** - Take your time to consider the approach
2. **Provide feedback** - Share any concerns, suggestions, or changes
3. **I'll revise the plan** - Create an updated version incorporating your feedback
4. **You approve** - Give explicit approval to proceed
5. **Execution begins** - Implementation tracked in T01_3_execution.md

**Please consider**:
- Does this approach align with your vision for the feature?
- Are the priorities and phases correct?
- Any missing requirements or edge cases?
- Preferred technical approaches or patterns?
- Integration concerns to address?
