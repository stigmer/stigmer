## Current Status

**Created**: 2026-03-20 10:41
**Current Task**: T01 — Phase 1: Library Pages + Navigation (Foundation)
**Status**: In Progress

## Session Progress (2026-03-20, Session 1)

### Completed
- **T01.1 — `useAgentList` data hook**: Fully implemented and exported
  - Created internal `useResourceList` hook in `sdk/react/src/search/useResourceList.ts`
    - Pagination (offset-based `page`/`pageSize`), scope toggle (`"org"` | `"all"`), text query
    - Follows all established patterns: `useState`/`useEffect`, `cancelled.current`, `fetchKey` refetch
  - Created public `useAgentList` hook in `sdk/react/src/agent/useAgentList.ts`
    - Thin wrapper remapping `entries` → `agents` for domain-specific naming
  - Updated barrel exports in `search/index.ts`, `agent/index.ts`, `sdk/react/src/index.ts`
  - TypeScript check clean, zero lint errors

### Key Discoveries (from codebase exploration)
1. `AgentClient.list()` delegates to `SearchService.search()` — returns `SearchResult[]` projections, not full `Agent` resources. Correct for list views.
2. Pagination is offset-based (`{ num, size }`), not cursor-based as the T01_0_plan stated.
3. `useAgentSearch` already exists wrapping the same API — serves picker/type-ahead UX (debounced, page 1 only). `useAgentList` serves Library browse UX (externally-controlled params, pagination, scope).
4. Scope maps to `excludePublic` on `ListParams`: `"org"` → `excludePublic: true`, `"all"` → `excludePublic: false`.

### Design Decisions (recorded in `design-decisions/`)
- DD-001 through DD-005 were recorded during planning (pre-existing)

## Session Progress (2026-03-20, Session 2)

### Completed
- **T01.2 — `useSkillList` data hook**: Fully implemented and exported
  - Created `sdk/react/src/skill/useSkillList.ts` — thin wrapper over `useResourceList`
  - Returns `{ skills, totalCount, totalPages, currentPage, isLoading, error, refetch }`
  - Full JSDoc with `@link` cross-reference to `useSkillSearch`, usage examples
  - Updated barrel exports in `skill/index.ts`

- **T01.3 — `useMcpServerList` data hook**: Fully implemented and exported
  - Created `sdk/react/src/mcp-server/useMcpServerList.ts` — thin wrapper over `useResourceList`
  - Returns `{ mcpServers, totalCount, totalPages, currentPage, isLoading, error, refetch }`
  - Full JSDoc with `@link` cross-reference to `useMcpServerSearch`, usage examples
  - Updated barrel exports in `mcp-server/index.ts`

- **Barrel exports updated**: Both module-level and top-level `sdk/react/src/index.ts` barrel exports updated with new hooks and types

### Verification
- TypeScript check passes (8 pre-existing errors in unrelated test file, zero in new/modified files)
- Lint clean on all 5 files (2 new, 3 modified)
- All existing exports unchanged — no breaking changes

## Next Steps

1. **T01.4 — `useResourceCount` data hook**: Fetches counts for landing page cards
2. **T01.5 — `ScopeToggle` component**: Segmented control UI (first UI component in Library module)
3. **T01.6 — `ResourceListView` component**: Generic list with search + scope
4. **T01.7 — `ResourceCountCard` component**: Landing page card with count
5. **T01.8 — Barrel exports for library module**
6. Continue through T01.9–T01.13 (sidebar, pages)

## Context for Resume

- All three resource list hooks are now complete (`useAgentList`, `useSkillList`, `useMcpServerList`)
- All three follow the identical pattern: thin wrapper over `useResourceList`, domain-named entries field
- The `search/` module exports both `useResourceSearch` (for pickers) and `useResourceList` (for Library)
- Next work shifts from data hooks to UI components — T01.4 is the last data hook, T01.5 starts the component layer
- Branch: `feat/add-customize-ui-2`

## Quick Commands

After loading context:
- "Continue with T01.4" — Implement useResourceCount (landing page card counts)
- "Continue with T01.5" — Implement ScopeToggle component (first UI work)
- "Show project status" — Get overview of progress
- "Create checkpoint" — Save current progress
- "Review guidelines" — Check established patterns
