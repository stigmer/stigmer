## Project: 20260518.01.unified-runner-migration

**Description**: Migrate Python agent-runner and TypeScript cursor-runner into a single unified TypeScript runner service (`backend/services/runner/`), eliminating Python from the agent execution path and creating a common codebase for both LangGraph deep agents and Cursor SDK harnesses.

**Goal**: Single TypeScript runner service that handles ExecuteDeepAgent, ExecuteCursor, EnsureThread, DiscoverMcpServer, and ClassifyToolApprovals — with all shared infrastructure unified. Python agent-runner, cursor-runner, and graphton library deleted after validated cutover.

**Tech Stack**: TypeScript/Node.js, Temporal SDK, deepagents JS (npm), LangGraph JS, Connect-ES (gRPC), @bufbuild/protobuf, Vitest

## Current State

**Created**: 2026-05-18 15:11  
**Last Session**: 2026-05-19 — Phase 4 DiscoverMcpServer port  
**Current Task**: Phase 4 — Supporting Activities (in progress)  
**Status**: DiscoverMcpServer COMPLETE — all 5 runner activities now ported to TypeScript; 403 tests passing

## Session Progress (2026-05-19, latest)

### What Was Accomplished (Phase 4 — DiscoverMcpServer)

**2 new files**:
- **activities/discover-mcp-server.ts** — `createDiscoverMcpServerActivities(config)` factory; MCP server discovery using MultiServerMCPClient + raw MCP Client for listTools/listResourceTemplates; toolsFingerprint(); extractPreviousState(); injectPlatformEnv()
- **activities/__tests__/discover-mcp-server.test.ts** — 27 tests covering factory registration, fingerprinting, previous state extraction, core discovery, error handling, idle watchdog

**Modified files:**
- `shared/mcp-resolver.ts` — exported `mcpServerToResolved()` for reuse
- `main.ts` — registers DiscoverMcpServerCapabilities alongside the other 4 activities

**Key decisions**: Used MultiServerMCPClient + getClient(slug) for raw MCP SDK access (preserves JSON Schema inputSchema). No filterEnvToDeclaredKeys in discovery path (matches Python — backend already scopes ExecutionContext). Reused existing mcpServerToResolved() instead of duplicating config transformation.

### Prior Sessions

- **Phase 4 EnsureThread (2026-05-19)**: Thread ID resolution — see `checkpoints/2026-05-19-session-9-phase4-ensurethread.md`
- **Phase 3c (2026-05-19)**: HITL approval gate, sub-agent infrastructure — see `checkpoints/2026-05-19-session-8-phase3c.md`
- **Phase 3b-iii (2026-05-19)**: Artifact storage, inline publishing, writeback — see `checkpoints/2026-05-19-session-7-phase3b-iii.md`

- **Phase 2 (2026-05-19)**: Core shared infrastructure — see `checkpoints/2026-05-19-session-3-phase2.md`
- **Phase 1 (2026-05-19 earlier)**: Service scaffold, single queue, ExecuteCursor ported

## Next Steps

1. **Phase 4: Supporting Activities (in progress)** — ~~EnsureThread~~ DONE; ~~ClassifyToolApprovals~~ DONE; ~~DiscoverMcpServer~~ DONE; next: ConnectMcpServerWorkflow (Temporal workflow orchestrating discover → classify); then: summarization middleware verification (DeepAgents JS built-in vs custom port); `@langchain/openai` multi-provider support; MCP package pre-installer; connect backfill for undiscovered servers; skill relevance filtering
2. **Phase 5: Testing** — port Python tests, integration, HITL e2e

## Context for Resume

- Unified runner: `backend/services/runner/` — ExecuteCursor production-ready; ExecuteDeepAgent has full streaming pipeline + middleware stack + artifact/writeback; EnsureThread ported from Python; ClassifyToolApprovals ported with @langchain/openai structured output; DiscoverMcpServerCapabilities ported with MultiServerMCPClient + raw MCP Client access
- Discovery: `src/activities/discover-mcp-server.ts` — connects via stdio or HTTP, enumerates tools + resource templates, computes tools fingerprint, extracts previous state for connect workflow short-circuit
- Artifact storage: `src/shared/artifact-storage.ts` (interface, local, proxy, factory)
- Inline publisher: `src/activities/execute-deep-agent/inline-publisher.ts` (fire-and-forget, SHA-256 dedup)
- Writeback coordinator: `src/activities/execute-deep-agent/writeback-coordinator.ts` (incremental git, per-entry mutex)
- Post-stream: `src/activities/execute-deep-agent/post-stream.ts` + `auto-publish.ts`
- Middleware: `src/middleware/` (types, think-tool, tool-truncation, error-hints, loop-detection, graceful-stop, execution-budget, cost-cap, otel-spans, approval-gate, index)
- Shared modules: `src/shared/` (status, checkpointer, workspace, mcp-manager, mcp-resolver, grpc-retry, model-pricing, artifact-storage, approval-policy, subagent-gate, model-registry, placeholder-resolver)
- Deep agent modules: `src/activities/execute-deep-agent/` (index, setup, environment, prompt-builder, status-builder, streaming, streaming-scheduler, execution-state, inline-publisher, writeback-coordinator, auto-publish, post-stream, hitl, subagent-wiring)
- Python `agent-runner` still handles `ExecuteGraphton` on the base queue until cutover
- `cursor-runner` remains in production until Phase 7 cleanup

## Deferred Items

### ~~Phase 3b-iii (Artifacts + Writeback)~~ — COMPLETE
- ~~Artifact storage + inline publisher~~ Done (local + proxy backends, fire-and-forget publish, SHA-256 dedup)
- ~~Writeback coordinator~~ Done (incremental git, per-entry mutex, GitHub PR creation)
- ~~Post-stream safety net~~ Done (auto-publish + writeback finalize)

### ~~Phase 3c (HITL + Approval)~~ — COMPLETE
- ~~HITL interrupt/resume~~ Done (approval gate middleware + `Command(resume=...)` builder)
- ~~Approval policy integration~~ Done (middleware-based, platform tool defaults)
- ~~Sub-agent concurrency limiter~~ Done (`SubAgentGate`, max 3, non-blocking rejection)
- ~~Sub-agent middleware wiring~~ Done (`buildSubAgentMiddleware()` with `forSubAgent()` cost cap)
- ~~Sub-agent budget policies~~ Done (periodic mode: interval=30, max=4 advisories)
- Summarization middleware → deferred to Phase 4 (DD-10)

### Phase 4+ (Supporting)
- ConnectMcpServerWorkflow (Temporal workflow: discover → classify)
- `@langchain/openai` multi-provider model support
- MCP package pre-installer (npm/pip install before tool connections)
- Connect backfill for undiscovered/stale MCP servers
- Skill relevance filtering (exclude low-relevance skills when count >= 8)
- Remote workspace backend (Daytona sandbox)

## Open Questions / Design Notes

- **Cursor Cloud + native stdio MCP**: npx/node-based stdio generally works when passed to Cursor SDK; arbitrary local binaries do not. Deep-agent stdio is runner-managed.
- **HttpCheckpointSaver**: Must stay wire-compatible with Java proxy (`$binary` serde format)
- **streamEvents**: Phase 3b-i switched from `invoke()` to `streamEvents()` v2. StatusBuilder consumes events and builds status proto progressively. Persistence cadence uses hybrid time+event scheduler.
- **StigmerMiddleware type**: Defined locally in `src/middleware/types.ts` because `AgentMiddleware` is not directly importable from `deepagents` (it's a transitive type from nested `langchain`). Structurally compatible — langchain uses structural typing.
- **Artifact storage proxy flow**: Runner calls `POST /v1/proxy/artifacts/presigned-upload-url` to get presigned URL, then PUTs content directly to R2. No R2 credentials in the runner.
- **Incremental writeback**: Branch `stigmer/{first8chars}` created on first file write. PR auto-updates on subsequent pushes. finalize() catches files modified by shell commands or other non-tool paths.
