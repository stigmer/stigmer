# 20260531.01.cursor-bidi-proxy-phase2

## Overview
Build a Netty-based BiDi HTTP/2 proxy handler in the Java service to make Cursor billing proxy-authoritative. The proxy intercepts the full-duplex AgentService/Run stream, extracts usage from bytes on the wire, and removes dependency on runner-reported data.

**Created**: 2026-05-31  
**Estimated Time**: 1-4 hours  
**Status**: 🚧 In Progress

## Goal
Deploy a working Netty BiDi proxy on port 8082 that transparently forwards Cursor SDK Connect RPC streams to api2.cursor.sh while extracting billing usage, functioning correctly in local desktop dev (make desktop-dev), released desktop apps, and production Kubernetes deployment.

## Technology Stack
Java/Netty/Spring Boot (stigmer-cloud), TypeScript (runner), Kustomize/Planton (deployment), Caddy (local dev proxy)

## Affected Components
stigmer-cloud: Netty server + handler + Spring lifecycle; stigmer: runner CURSOR_BACKEND_URL routing, Caddy local dev config, desktop app proxy endpoint; stigmer-cloud _kustomize: port 8082 in base + prod overlays; Planton deployment: ingress/service port
