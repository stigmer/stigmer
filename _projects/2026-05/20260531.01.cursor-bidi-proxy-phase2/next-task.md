## Project Overview

**Name**: 20260531.01.cursor-bidi-proxy-phase2  
**Description**: Build a Netty-based BiDi HTTP/2 proxy handler in the Java service to make Cursor billing proxy-authoritative. The proxy intercepts the full-duplex AgentService/Run stream, extracts usage from bytes on the wire, and removes dependency on runner-reported data.  
**Goal**: Deploy a working Netty BiDi proxy on port 8082 that transparently forwards Cursor SDK Connect RPC streams to api2.cursor.sh while extracting billing usage, functioning correctly in local desktop dev (make desktop-dev), released desktop apps, and production Kubernetes deployment.  
**Tech Stack**: Java/Netty/Spring Boot (stigmer-cloud), TypeScript (runner), Kustomize/Planton (deployment), Caddy (local dev proxy)  
**Components**: stigmer-cloud: Netty server + handler + Spring lifecycle; stigmer: runner CURSOR_BACKEND_URL routing, Caddy local dev config, desktop app proxy endpoint; stigmer-cloud _kustomize: port 8082 in base + prod overlays; Planton deployment: ingress/service port

## Resume Checklist

When starting a new session, quickly review:

1. [ ] Open `tasks.md` and check current task status

## Current Status

**Last Updated**: 2026-05-31  
**Last Session**: Completed Task 3 (kustomize + HTTPRoute deployment for port 8082).  
**Current Focus**: Task 4 — Wire released desktop app and remote runners

## Session Progress (2026-05-31, session 2)

- Completed Task 3: port 8082 exposed in kustomize base + HTTPRoute applied to prod cluster
- Added `cursor-bidi-proxy` port to `_kustomize/base/service.yaml` with `appProtocol: http2`
- Created `stigmer-cursor-bidi-path-route.yaml` — routes `PathPrefix /aiserver.v1` → port 8082
- Applied HTTPRoute to `stigmer-prod` namespace via `kubectl apply`
- Verified: Istio gateway controller accepted the route (Accepted: True, ResolvedRefs: True)
- Route will 503 until next service deploy rolls out container with port 8082 — expected and harmless

## Session Progress (2026-05-31, session 1)

- Completed Task 2: runner routes Connect RPC through Caddy → Netty :8082 via path-based routing
- Key design decision: NO new env var. Follow the same `stigmer-proxy-path-route.yaml` pattern port 8081 uses
- `CURSOR_API_BASE_URL` = proxy endpoint (no path prefix); Caddy/Istio routes `/aiserver.v1*` to :8082
- Auth: CURSOR_API_KEY carries STIGMER_TOKEN JWT in proxy mode (proxy validates, replaces with real Cursor key)
- Verified: CursorBidiStreamHandler uses Spring Security BearerTokenAuthenticationToken — compatible
- All unit tests passing (14/14)

## Context for Resume

- Tasks 1, 2, 3 are DONE. The Netty handler is built, local dev is wired, and prod routing is deployed.
- HTTPRoute `stigmer-cursor-bidi-path-route` is live in `stigmer-prod` namespace (will 503 until next deploy)
- The kustomize base change (port 8082) will take effect on the next CI deploy of stigmer-service
- Task 4 is about ensuring CURSOR_BACKEND_URL resolves correctly in released desktop, CLI daemon, and cloud runners

## Next Steps

1. Task 4: Ensure released desktop builds pass correct CURSOR_BACKEND_URL to runner
2. Task 4: Verify CLI daemon mode config derives BiDi proxy URL
3. Task 4: Verify cloud runner (pod-to-pod) uses internal service DNS
4. Task 5: End-to-end validation with real Cursor API key
