# Rule: Get Deep Research Help for Stigmer OSS

## Purpose

Workflow for getting external research help from Deep Research Agents (ChatGPT or Gemini) when collaboration requires additional context, market research, technical deep dives, or background checks that benefit from AI-powered web research.

## Triggers

### Trigger 1: Start New Research
User mentions this rule and provides:
1. **Required**: A folder location where the research folder should be created
2. **Optional**: A title/identifier for the research topic

### Trigger 2: Answer Questions (Auto)
User attaches/drags a `02.questions.md` file from any research folder.
- **Action**: Automatically read the questions and write answers to `03.answers.md` in the same folder
- No additional instructions required — just attaching the file triggers the response

### Trigger 3: Import Report (Auto)
User provides a path to a `.docx` file (ChatGPT Deep Research export) and the research folder location.
- **Action**: Run the `convert` command to convert .docx to markdown, then analyze the report
- See Step 6 for details

## Workflow

### Step 1: Create Research Folder

Create a subfolder in the specified location with the naming convention:

```
research.<lowercase-alphanumeric-hyphen-identifier>
```

**Examples:**
- `research.temporal-workflow-patterns`
- `research.grpc-streaming-best-practices`
- `research.bazel-remote-caching`
- `research.go-generics-patterns`

### Step 2: Create Standard Files

Create these empty files in the research folder:

```
01.prompt.md      # Research prompt to send to Deep Research Agent
02.questions.md   # Clarifying questions returned by the agent
03.answers.md     # Answers to provide back to the agent
04.report.gemini.md  # Final report from Gemini Deep Research
04.report.gpt.md     # Final report from ChatGPT Deep Research
```

### Step 3: Write the Research Prompt

Write a comprehensive research prompt in `01.prompt.md` based on:
- Current conversation context
- The specific information needed
- Why this research matters for the decision/task at hand

**Prompt Requirements:**
- Clear research objective
- Known information as starting points
- Specific areas to investigate
- Request for authoritative sources with citations
- Output format expectations

### Step 4: User Takes Prompt to Deep Research Agent

User copies the prompt from `01.prompt.md` and submits to:
- ChatGPT Deep Research, OR
- Gemini Deep Research

### Step 5: Handle Clarifying Questions

When the Deep Research Agent returns clarifying questions:
1. User pastes questions into `02.questions.md`
2. User drags/attaches `02.questions.md` to the conversation
3. **Agent automatically writes answers to `03.answers.md` in the same folder**
4. User provides answers back to Deep Research Agent

**Auto-trigger:** When user attaches any `02.questions.md` file from a research folder, immediately read the questions and write comprehensive answers to the sibling `03.answers.md` file without requiring additional instructions.

### Step 6: Import and Analyze Final Report

When Deep Research Agent completes the research:

#### For ChatGPT Reports (.docx export)

1. User downloads report as `.docx` file (ChatGPT's export format)
2. User provides the `.docx` file path and research folder location
3. **Agent runs the `convert` command:**

```bash
convert '<source.docx>' '<research-folder>/04.report.gpt.md'
```

**Important:** Always use **single quotes** around file paths because ChatGPT export filenames often contain spaces and special characters (colons, apostrophes, etc.).

The `convert` alias uses pandoc to convert .docx to GitHub-flavored markdown with media extraction.

4. **Agent reads the converted report and provides:**
   - Summary of key findings
   - Notable information discovered
   - Any red flags or concerns identified
   - Recommended next steps for review
   - Questions or areas that may need follow-up

#### For Gemini Reports

- Copy/paste directly into `04.report.gemini.md`
- Agent analyzes and summarizes as above

**Auto-trigger:** When user provides a `.docx` path and mentions it's a Deep Research report, automatically:
1. Run the convert command to the appropriate `04.report.gpt.md`
2. Read the converted markdown
3. Provide analysis and next steps

## Example Usage

### Example 1: Start New Research

**User says:**
> @get-deep-research-help-for-stigmer-oss 
> Create research folder in `_projects/2026-01/` titled "temporal-saga-patterns"

**Agent actions:**
1. Creates `_projects/2026-01/research.temporal-saga-patterns/`
2. Creates standard files (01.prompt.md through 04.report.*.md)
3. Writes research prompt based on conversation context

### Example 2: Import ChatGPT Report

**User says:**
> Here's the report: `~/Downloads/Deep research on gRPC streaming patterns.docx`
> Save to `_projects/2026-01/research.grpc-streaming/`

**Agent actions:**
1. Runs: `convert '~/Downloads/Deep research on gRPC streaming patterns.docx' '_projects/2026-01/research.grpc-streaming/04.report.gpt.md'`
2. Reads the converted markdown report
3. Provides summary of findings, key insights, red flags, and next steps

## Notes

- Research folders are prefixed with `research.` for easy identification
- Multiple research efforts can exist in the same parent folder
- Reports are kept in the repository for future reference
- Both Gemini and ChatGPT reports can be captured for comparison
- Common research topics for Stigmer OSS: Go patterns, Bazel build system, gRPC/protobuf, Temporal workflows, CLI design patterns
