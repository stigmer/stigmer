# Start Quick Project

## Rule Type
**ACTION RULE** - This rule performs actions and creates files.

## Purpose
Interview the developer and bootstrap a new **lightweight project** using the Next Quick Project Framework. This framework is for projects that will complete in 1-2 sessions (typically < 4 hours total), as opposed to multi-day projects that need the full Next Project Framework.

## When to Use This Rule vs Full Framework

### Use This Quick Framework When:
- Project will complete in 1-2 sessions (< 4 hours)
- Scope is well-defined and focused
- No complex architectural decisions requiring extensive documentation
- Need structure but must move fast
- Examples: Bug fixes, small features, quick refactors, utility scripts, proto field additions

### Use Full Framework (@_projects/_rules/next-stigmer-project/start-stigmer-new-project) When:
- Project spans 3+ days or multiple long sessions
- Complex architectural decisions need documentation
- Team collaboration or handoffs expected
- Scope might evolve significantly

## Project Structure Created

The quick framework creates a minimal structure organized by month in `_projects/`:

```
_projects/
└── YYYY-MM/                           # Month folder (e.g., 2026-01)
    └── YYYYMMDD.NN.<project-name>/    # Date + sequence prefixed project folder
        ├── README.md          # Single-page project overview
        ├── next-task.md       # Quick resume file (drag into chat!)
        ├── tasks.md           # All tasks tracked in one file
        └── notes.md           # Quick notes and learnings
```

**Note**: Projects are automatically organized by month with sequence numbers (01, 02, 03...) for projects created on the same day.

Just **4 files** instead of 10+ in the full framework!

## Interview Process

Ask the developer these streamlined questions:

### 1. Project Name (Required)
```
What would you like to name this quick project?
(Use kebab-case, e.g., 'fix-auth-timeout' or 'add-workflow-labels')
Note: This will be automatically prefixed with today's date (YYYYMMDD), a sequence number (NN), 
and placed in the current month folder (YYYY-MM)
```

### 2. Brief Description (Required)
```
Briefly describe what this project does (1-2 sentences):
```

### 3. Primary Goal (Required)
```
What is the main goal or desired outcome?
(e.g., "Fix authentication timeout causing login failures")
```

### 4. Technology Stack (Required)
```
What technology stack are you using?
(e.g., "Go/Bazel", "TypeScript/React", "Java/gRPC", "Proto/Buf", "Dart/Flutter")
```

### 5. Affected Components (Required)
```
Which components or areas will be changed?
(e.g., "workflow-runner service", "auth APIs", "CLI commands", "mobile app UI")
```

### 6. Initial Task Breakdown (Optional)
```
Do you already have an idea of the tasks, or should I suggest a breakdown?
(If they provide tasks, use them. Otherwise, propose a 2-4 task breakdown based on the goal)
```

### 7. Success Criteria (Optional)
```
How will you know this is complete? (Optional - I can infer from the goal)
```

## After Gathering Information

1. **Confirm the plan:**
   ```
   Based on your input, I'll create a quick project:
   
   Name: [name]
   Goal: [goal]
   Tech: [tech]
   Components: [components]
   
   Location: _projects/YYYY-MM/YYYYMMDD.NN.[name]/
   
   Estimated tasks: [2-5 tasks]
   
   Proceed with creation?
   ```

2. **If approved, create the project** using the bootstrap script:
   ```bash
   python3 tools/projects/bootstrap_quick_project.py \
     --name "[name]" \
     --description "[description]" \
     --goal "[goal]" \
     --tech "[tech]" \
     --components "[components]" \
     --tasks "[task1;task2;task3]"
   ```

3. **After creation, provide guidance:**
   ```
   ✅ Quick project created at: _projects/YYYY-MM/YYYYMMDD.NN.[name]/
   
   📋 Created files:
   - README.md (project overview)
   - next-task.md (drag into chat to resume!)
   - tasks.md (task tracking)
   - notes.md (quick notes)
   
   🚀 Ready to start! 
   
   Next steps:
   1. Review the task breakdown in tasks.md
   2. Review the project structure and files created
   3. Let me know how you'd like to proceed
   
   💡 To resume later: Just drag next-task.md into any chat
   ```

4. **Ask how to proceed:**
   ```
   How would you like to proceed with this project?
   ```

## Task Breakdown Guidelines

When suggesting tasks, keep it simple (2-5 tasks):

### For Bug Fixes:
1. Reproduce and identify root cause
2. Implement fix
3. Test and validate

### For Small Features:
1. Design approach
2. Implement core functionality
3. Add UI/styling (if applicable)
4. Test and validate

### For Proto API Work:
1. Define proto messages and services
2. Generate stubs (Go/Java/TypeScript/Dart)
3. Update backend handlers
4. Test with sample requests

### For Scripts/Tools:
1. Parse input/setup
2. Core logic implementation
3. Error handling and validation
4. Testing and documentation

### For Quick Refactors:
1. Analyze current implementation
2. Refactor with tests
3. Validate no regressions

### For Bazel/Build Issues:
1. Identify dependency issue
2. Update BUILD.bazel files
3. Validate build succeeds

### For CLI Enhancements:
1. Design command/flags
2. Implement with cobra
3. Add help documentation
4. Test various scenarios

## Important Notes

### Keep It Lightweight
- **No review workflows** - trust and move fast
- **Single file tracking** - all tasks in tasks.md
- **Minimal documentation** - just notes.md for learnings
- **Fast execution** - structure without ceremony

### Status Markers
Use these in tasks.md:
- `⏸️ TODO` - Not started
- `🚧 IN PROGRESS` - Currently working
- `✅ DONE` - Completed

### When to Upgrade
If during the project you notice:
- Growing to 6+ tasks
- Complex architectural decisions emerging
- Spanning into 3rd session
- Needing multiple design decisions documented

**Suggest upgrading to the full Next Project Framework:**
```
This project is growing beyond quick project scope. 
Would you like me to migrate it to the full Next Project Framework?
This would give you:
- Individual task files with review workflow
- Knowledge folders for design decisions, guidelines, etc.
- Better structure for multi-day work
```

## Next Quick Project Philosophy

**Fast Structure, Not Heavy Process**

The quick framework gives you:
- ✅ Clear goals and success criteria
- ✅ Task-by-task structured progress
- ✅ Context persistence (next-task.md)
- ✅ Learning capture (notes.md)

Without:
- ❌ Review overhead
- ❌ Multiple files per task
- ❌ Extensive knowledge folders
- ❌ Formal checkpoints

Perfect for focused work that needs structure but must move fast.

## Example Conversation Flow

```
User: @_projects/_rules/next-stigmer-quick-project/start-stigmer-quick-project

AI: I'll help you bootstrap a lightweight project! Let me ask a few quick questions...

What would you like to name this project? (use kebab-case)

User: fix-workflow-timeout

AI: Great! Briefly describe what this project does (1-2 sentences):

User: Fix the workflow execution timeout issue causing jobs to fail prematurely

AI: Perfect! What's the main goal?

User: Increase execution timeout from 5 minutes to 30 minutes and make it configurable

AI: What technology stack?

User: Go/gRPC with Bazel

AI: Which components will be affected?

User: workflow-runner service and config management

AI: Based on this, I suggest these tasks:
1. Identify current timeout configuration
2. Update timeout logic and make configurable
3. Test with various timeout values

Does this work, or do you want to adjust?

User: Looks good

AI: Perfect! Creating your quick project...

[Creates structure]

✅ Quick project created at: _projects/2026-01/20260116.01.fix-workflow-timeout/

```

## Success Metrics

The quick framework works when:
- Setup takes < 2 minutes
- Projects complete in 1-2 sessions
- Developer can resume instantly with next-task.md
- Minimal overhead, maximum focus
- Easy to upgrade if scope expands
